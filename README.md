# Educational Planner 

## *Personal Project*

This application is an educational planner that allows students to keep track of their overall averages
in their courses using the grades they input from each of the course's assignments. 
    
This project is of interest to me because I'm aware that some schools may not offer software that allows their 
students to track their progress and evaluate their academic weak points. In today's educational environment, being
able to keep track of your grades and continuously improve academically is crucial to getting accepted
into a good university, which may eventually help in procuring a successful career. 

This application can be used by **any** student that wants to keep track of their academical progress,
but will mostly be targeted towards students that don't already have grade tracking software provided by their school
because their school's application may offer other features more specific to their students.
