# Space Escape

## CPSC 210 â€“ *Personal Project*

This application is a game where the user plays as a spaceship trying to escape from an enemy base. There will be enemy spaceships shooting projectiles,
and asteroids falling down that will try to damage the player. To defend themselves, the player can shoot projectiles from their spaceship, move in all directions
(up, down, left, and right), and will be able to gain back their health by collecting health pickups that fall occasionally. After a set amount of time, a boss will spawn and have significantly better 
stats than the enemy spaceships. Once the player defeats the boss, the player will have escaped the enemy base and beat the game. 
    
This game can be played by **anyone**, but will mostly be targeted towards children because the game mechanics will not be too advanced and older players may find the game 
to be boring as a result. This project is of interest to me because I've always wanted to code a space-themed game but was not sure how to start. I believe that this personal project
is the perfect opportunity to help me achieve this goal.
